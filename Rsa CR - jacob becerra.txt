There were some difficulties in the process of making our program. For example we had an issue with a loop for the beginning of the program, you are given the choices to encrypt, decrypt, or stop the program. Whatever you chose, the program would stop no matter what, upon further inspection, we noticed that the loop we created was being stopped by any response so we had to rework the loop in order for the program to go any further. Our next problem was that the values used for encryption and decryption were being addressed before we even used them, we had to end up changing the code, depending on what option you chose(encrypt or decrypt) it would then ask you for those values instead of having then assigned before you did anything, the problem was that the values would be assigned before you did anything and would not allow the program to run correctly.
